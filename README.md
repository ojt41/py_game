#Collecting Game
This is a simple game created using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control a robot to collect coins while avoiding monsters. The robot can move using the arrow keys and must collect coins scattered around the screen. If the robot collides with a monster, the player loses 2 coins and is knocked back to prevent continuous collisions. The game continues until the player either collects all the coins (50 or more) or runs out of coins (0 or fewer).

#How to Play
Make sure you have Python and the Pygame library installed.
Download the game assets: robot.png, coin.png, and monster.png.
Save the downloaded images in the same directory as the game script.
Run the script using the command: python script_name.py (replace script_name.py with the actual script filename).

#Instructions
Use the arrow keys to control the robot's movement.
The objective is to collect coins while avoiding monsters.
Colliding with a monster deducts 2 coins and knocks the robot away.
The robot is invincible for the first 3 seconds.
The game ends when you either collect all the coins (50 or more) or run out of coins (0 or fewer).
If you lose or win, press 'R' to restart the game or 'Q' to quit.

#Gameplay
Run the script to start the game.
Follow the instructions displayed on the screen.
